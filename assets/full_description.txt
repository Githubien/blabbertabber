LetMeSpeak is a diarization software to measure time of speech of each participant in a meeting.
It is conceived as a feminist tool to reestablish equity between men and women in meetings, but can be used for other purposes.

WARNING: this software currently send all audio for remote processing to a private company owned server (IBM Dr Watson, currently) and so shouldn't be used for anything confidential.
We of course plane to change that, but that may takes a -long- time.

The code is heavily based on BlabberTabber ( https://github.com/blabbertabber/blabbertabber/ ), so much that for now it's a pure copy of it.

Be considerate: when recording a meeting, make sure you have the consent of everyone at the meeting. If you don't, you may be breaking the law.
